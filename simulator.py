"""
This is a visualiser for the neopixel library for those that just want to simulate the code.
It is a mostly drop-in replacement for the normal library.
Based on the simulator by DutChen18. Source: https://github.com/standupmaths/xmastree2020/pull/5/files
Changes:
Moves the matplotlib code to a new thread so that the updating code does not block the UI
Adds a method to set the pixel locations so that they are not hard coded
Made the axis proportional in size
Potential future work:
Consider adding support for pixel colour order.
    Unsure if the one Matt is running uses this
Usage:
You will need to import it like this.
try:
    # Try an import the real neopixel library
    import board
    import neopixel
except ImportError as e1:
    # If the real neopixel library cannot be imported try and import the simulator
    print(f"Failed to import board and neopixel. Trying the simulator.\n{e1}")
    try:
        from simulator import board, neopixel
    except ImportError as e2:
        # If the simulator failed to import, print the error and exit
        print(f"Failed to import the simulator. \n{e2}\nExiting.")
        sys.exit(1)
# construct the neopixel interface in the normal way
pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(
    board.D18, len(coords), auto_write=False
)
# You will then need to set the location of each pixel.
# This is a custom method that does not exist in the real library.
# Call it like this to catch and ignore the error when run on the real hardware.
try:
    pixels.set_pixel_locations(coords)
